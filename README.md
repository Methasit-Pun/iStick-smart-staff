Key features include 
1. fall detection
2. GPS tracking
3. An emergency button designed to immediately connect users with their local hospital for urgent assistance.
  
The primary objective is to create a reliable alert system that promptly notifies caregivers in the event of an incident involving the user, aligning with **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.**

**Technologies Used:**
Hardware: ESP32 module, GPS module, accelerometer/gyroscope sensors (MPU6050), push button, jumper wires, 5-12V battery.
Software: Arduino IDE for coding the ESP32, external libraries for sensor integration (e.g., MPU6050 library), real-time data processing algorithms for fall detection.
Design Tools: 3D CAD programs for designing the cane head and overall structure.

Outcome: Achieved accurate fall detection and reliable GPS tracking, providing a scalable prototype for improved elderly care.
